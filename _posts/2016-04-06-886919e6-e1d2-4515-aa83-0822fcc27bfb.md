=BOOT PROCESS=

1 - Power On and POST (Loading of BIOS from EEPROM on MoBo into RAM)

POST: Power On Self Test -- POST checks and confirms the integrity of hardware components

2 - BIOS Loads and performs various hardware checks (HID, RAM, Boot mediums, etc.)

3 - BIOS then reads the MBR (Master Boot Record) of the Master SCSI/IDE boot medium.

4 - GRUB/LILO then loads and the user is prompted to make a selection on which kernel/OS to load.

5 - GRUB/LILO then loads the kernel into RAM.

6 - The kernel then creates a ramdisk and loads initr.d/systemd into it and extracts any necessary modules.

7 - The kernel then preps the OS and mounts the root partition to "/"

8 - The kernel finalizes by running the initr.d/systemd scripts/daemons which launch various user-level services such as Apache or LightDM and also dumps it's initial ramdisk freeing up that memory.
